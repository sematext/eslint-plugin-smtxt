We migrated to [oxlint](https://github.com/oxc-project/oxc).

## ESLint plugin Sematext
If you make some changes in src/ you will need to run `npm install
./eslint-plugin-smtxt` to install the changes locally.

When you are finished with your changes, please update the version in
package.json before pushing the changes to central repository so that everyone
is notified by check-dependencies script that they need to run `npm install`.
